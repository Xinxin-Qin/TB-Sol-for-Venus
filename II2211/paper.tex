\subsection{riscv}
Researchers from TU graz developed FazyRV[1], a minimal-area open-source RV32I RISC-V core targeting IoT and low-workload applications, addressing the problem that 32-bit RISC-V processor cores reach a boundary on their minimal size. Their goal was to minimize area demand while fulfilling performance requirements and close the gap between prevalent 32-bit and 1-bit-serial RISC-V cores.\\
Qian Wei and his colleagues created a comprehensive survey of RISC-V instruction set architecture extensions because while RISC-V is popular for embedded processors [2], there is still a gap between RISC-V's capabilities and the requirements of various emerging computing scenarios like artificial intelligence and cloud computing.

\subsection{processors for venus}
Current research on high-temperature electronics for Venus has shown that SiC ICs can sustain operation for over a year at 500 °C and for months in simulated Venus conditions, supporting sensors and simple microprocessors. This demonstrates the feasibility of long-duration surface missions and motivates concepts like LLISSE targeting low-power seismic monitoring.[3] \\
At the processor level, studies of SiC-based computing infrastructures reveal that current prototypes achieve significantly lower throughput than space-proven silicon systems, yet provide guidelines at the microarchitecture and ISA levels for developing processors able to operate under Venus’s extreme environment.[4]\\
\subsection{FPGA}
One verification strategy is co-emulation, where the RTL design on the FPGA is run in parallel with a trusted software model, such as the Spike simulator[5], on a host PC. This allows for high-speed verification by comparing the core's architectural state against the simulator in real-time. Furthermore, using FPGAs with RISC-V is advantageous as it allows for optimized hardware, where the FPGA is configured with only the peripherals required for a specific application[6].

\section{Specification}
<Outlines the constraints this work has, if any>\\

\section{Architecture}
<How do I/we plan to build this gadget given the constraints I have?. This section is sometimes split into subsections like Hardware and Software>

\section{Experiments}
<What experiments have I done? This is more or less a specification of the experiments.>

\section{Results}
<What results did I get from the experiments. This section is sometimes merged with the experiments section>

\section{Conclusion}
<This is a retrospective look at the introduction, and should present answers to the questions asked there and throughout the paper.>

\subsection{Future Work}
<Optional section that describe possible future work>
